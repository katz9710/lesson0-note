<h1><b>Major concepts of web</b></h1>

<h2>Web overview</h2>
<p><b><em>Web is made up of interconnected network by network cables allover the world which host computer.</em></b> It is divided into browser,
which interpret the information sent by server, intranetwork, which connect user's computer to internet
through local network, server, which process the informarion sent by user's PC and send back appropriate
page and/or services. HTTP is the method of requeating and recieving data from server.</p>

<h2>HTML</h2>
<p><b><em>HTML stands for Hyper-Text-Markup-Language.</em></b> HTML is responsible for most of what information will be displayed
and how it displayed on user's computer. text-content describe what user sees and markup describes how it
looks. Although there are additional languages such as PHP or Javascrpt and such, but they all manipurates
HTML.</p>

<h2>Tag, Markup and element</h2>

<p>HTML is made up of tags which start with bracket and end with slash in bracket. These tags tell how the text
between these tags are formatted. <b><em>Markup is how the tag is maeking the text to show the style of these
texts.</em></b> Taken whole tags and texts are called element and stacking up these elements makes web page.</p>

<h2>The reason programmer calls computer stupid</h2>
<p>Programmer often calls computer stupid because <b><em>it does onlything user tells directly</em></b> and can not distinct
for example "Each of us saw her duck" as in if we saw her pet duck or she ducked under something. This cause
computer to behave very differently with just an small error inputed by programmer.</p>

just decoration, however Block has atteribute such as height and width and surround the text in that
